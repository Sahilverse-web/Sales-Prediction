#  Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a Data Science Task for my internship at Codsoft
This project predicts sales revenue using regression models based on many features.

## Dataset 
The dataset is given as advertising.csv

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-Test split

### Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

### Visualizations
- Feature importance bar plot
- Actual vs Predicted scatter plot
- Residual plot
- Heatmap of correlation matrix

## Results

- Random Forest Regressor provided the best R² score.
- Predictions are fairly accurate and can help in business planning.
